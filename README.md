The title of my project is Movie EXP. and the link to where it is deployed is https://capstone-movie-exp.vercel.app/.
PLEASE NOTE: The free instance of Render I am using spins down after some time being inactive, initial requests may be slow, 
in addition, on first time to the site, you will have to do a register followed by a sign in, as of right now, register does not also sign you in.

api used in this project:  https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/

I am currently working on updating and adding new tests for this project using Jest.

My website searches movies from the Movie Database Api, and allows users to sign up, log in, and save movies to their 'favorites'
which is accesible from the Favorites tab.

The standard user flow for the website can be either immediently navigating to the sign up/log in tab to complete that process
before searching movies and adding them to their favorites, however users can also just search movies without signing in, they just
can't favorite any movies in this case. 

The tech stack for this web app is react and node.
