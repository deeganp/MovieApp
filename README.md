api used in this project:  https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/

The title of my project is Movie EXP. and the link to where it is deployed is http://movie-exp.surge.sh/.
PLEASE NOTE: The free instance of Render I am using spins down after some time being inactive, initial requests may be slow, 
in addition, on first time to the site, you will have to do a register followed by a sign in, as of right now, register does not also sign you in.

I am consistently making chnages to improve this site, and have some stretch goals such as increasing the amount of movies you can see on a search, 
adding movie details and streaming availibilty, and improving the user log in expierience. 

My website searches movies from the Movie Database Api, and allows users to sign up, log in, and save movies to their 'favorites'
which is accesible from the Favorites tab.

There are several tests in the frontend that mock responses to certain requuests that can be ran using jest [test file name].

The standard user flow for the website can be either immediently navigating to the sign up/log in tab to complete that process
before searching movies and adding them to their favorites, however users can also just search movies without signing in, they just
can't favorite any movies in this case. 

The technology stack for this web app is react and node.
